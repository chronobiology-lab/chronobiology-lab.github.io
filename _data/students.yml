                Over the course of 7 years, I have developed expertise in diverse areas of computer science, including web development, cybersecurity, heterogeneous parallel computation systems, machine learning, and open-source software. Furthermore, I have been actively involved in volunteer work, such as translating for [Khan Academy Azerbaijani](https://az.khanacademy.org/), participating in university communities, and serving as chairperson in [the IZTECH IEEE Computer Society](https://ieee.iyte.edu.tr/komiteler/computer-society/) for a school year. Currently, I hold positions as both a board member and a project manager at the [Azerbaijani Neuroscience Society](https://neuroscience.az/).

#   description: I am a graduate student at the University of California, San Francisco in Health Data Science. I received 
#                my B.S. in Statistics from the University of British Columbia. I am interested in using task-based functional 
#                MRI, online population-based methods, and computational behavioral modeling to investigate the neural bases of 
#                decision-making in the aging brain, focusing on how brain systems involved in financial and medical decisions 
#                are influenced by health and disease. I would be honored to learn from the accomplished team of researchers 
#                and contribute to our lab's success. Outside of research, I enjoy doing sports and watching YouTube.
