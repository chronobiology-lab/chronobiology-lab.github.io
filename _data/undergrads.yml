  description: 
                Over the course of 7 years, I have developed expertise in diverse areas of computer science, including web development, cybersecurity, heterogeneous parallel computation systems, machine learning, and open-source software. Furthermore, I have been actively involved in volunteer work, such as translating for Khan Academy Azerbaijani, participating in university communities, and serving as chairperson in the IZTECH IEEE Computer Society for a school year. Currently, I hold positions as both a board member and a project manager at the Azerbaijani Neuroscience Society.

#   description: I am an epilepsy fellow at UCSF with additional training in 
#                medical ethics and humanities. I completed an ethics fellowship 
#                at Stanford University, where I also earned my MD. Before coming 
#                to San Francisco, I was a neurology resident at the University of 
#                Pennsylvania.
               
               
#                I have a strong clinical interest in surgical epilepsy, 
#                specifically in novel neuromodulatory devices like RNS. In the 
#                Decision Lab, I study the ethical, social, and legal implications 
#                of these devices on clinical care and research. I am particularly 
#                interested in patient-physician communication, patient and caregiver 
#                decision-making, and evolving paradigms for informed consent.
