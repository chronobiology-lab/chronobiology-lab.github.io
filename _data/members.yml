  description: 
                I am a neuroscientist specializing in sleep and circadian sciences. My research aims to identify the effects of light exposure on circadian rhythms, sleep, cognition and health. I work on development of home-based, digital and wearable devices measuring personal exposure to environmental regulators of biological timing (especially light), while also tracking physiological and behavioural systems under rhythmic control. My recent research interest is to standardize how we masure light exposure for human and animals to increase scientific accuracy and provide personalized light interventions. Additionally, my studies include genetic, epigenetic and behavioural biomarkers of healthy sleep development and ageing.

#   description:  Movements are files of a person’s life, learned, reproduced, and 
#                 altered as needed. There are external movements, those that make 
#                 us act on objects and internal movements, an energy that we use 
#                 in space and time. 
#                 My interest in the body as a ‘depository of human 
#                 expressiveness’ led me to a degree in Psychomotor Therapy with a 
#                 Master’s specialization in old age and mental health (University 
#                 of Lisbon). An enriching experience with an aging population 
#                 triggered my interest in old age, 
#                 and I realized how much I still had to learn about the 
#                 biological and physiological mechanisms of aging and the 
#                 disruptions that lead to age-related diseases. 
  
  
#                 My Master in Integrative Biology and Physiology, with 
#                 specialization in Cognitive Neurosciences (Pierre and Marie 
#                 Curie University, Paris), provided me with the basis for 
#                 understanding brain aging mechanisms. 
#                 My enthusiasm in this domain propelled me to pursue a PhD in 
#                 Cognitive Neurosciences (Sorbonne University) at the Paris Brain 
#                 Institute, working in the field of language in neurodegenerative 
#                 diseases and the use of transcranial stimulation as a possible 
#                 therapeutic approach. 
#                 As movements, each word also has a biography that is related to 
#                 the biography of the person using it. Understanding how one’s 
#                 language abilities are affected during a disease process is 
#                 another piece in the complex domain of neurodegeneration and its 
#                 consequences on one’s identity.


#                 I am interested in understanding how an individual responds to 
#                 aging in different spheres of life and how the identification of 
#                 altered mechanisms in pathological aging can help prevent early 
#                 cognitive and functional decline. 
#                 By joining the Decision Lab at the Memory and Aging Center, I am 
#                 excited to explore how the process of decision-making is 
#                 affected and which are the neural basis that subtends 
#                 decision-making alterations.

#                 incidents of early impaired judgment that could lead to 
#                 intervention strategies to decelerate the onset of frontotemporal
#                 dementia.

#                 My research interest sparked when I became a research assistant 
#                 at the Berkeley Social Interaction Lab, where I researched awe 
#                 and psychophysiology. 
#                 I loved working with participants, brainstorming new techniques, 
#                 and analyzing the results. My time in this lab has taught me 
#                 valuable lifelong skills and has reiterated that I want to 
#                 impact and help others through research.
                
                
#                 After taking coursework in Clinical Psychology and 
#                 Neuropsychology, I was eager to learn more about mental and 
#                 aging disorders, which ultimately led me to the Decision Lab.
#                 Studying case studies of patients with dementia emphasized how 
#                 much is still unknown. The complexity and debilitating effects 
#                 of aging disorders have motivated me to work with this clinical 
#                 population. 
#                 I am grateful to be a part of the Decision Lab, where I have the

#                 degree in neurobiology. At Berkeley, I studied in the lab of Dr. 
#                 Linda Wilbrecht where I completed an honors thesis investigating 
#                 adolescent exploration, risk-taking, and reward-seeking 
#                 behaviors and their neurophysiological correlates. 
#                 During this time, I developed a passion for research, 
#                 particularly reward processing and decision making, and how the 
#                 dysfunction of these processes is relevant to disease and 
#                 addiction.


#                 Experiences outside of academics have been instrumental in 
#                 helping to refine my interests. For example, I work as a crisis 
#                 counselor, assisting folks in getting through challenging

#                 backgrounds to 
#                 be critical and fulfilling, and I resolved to fuse this 
#                 meaningful work with my passion for research. I became 
#                 particularly interested in studying dementia, as this topic is 
#                 personal to me, and there is still so much to understand about 
#                 different dementias.


#                 I am extremely excited to be working as a clinical research 
#                 coordinator in both the Decision Lab and the lab of Dr. David 
#                 Perry. The research conducted by these groups integrates my

#                essential in society, so I am incredibly interested in 
#                researching and assisting with projects that enhance their 
#                quality of life. This is one of many reasons I believe in and 
#                value the research at the UCSF Memory and Aging Center and why 
#                I’m 
#                excited about the work that I am doing as a member of the 
#                Decision lab, specifically on the 
#                [Genes, Brains and Decisions](/projects/index.html#gbd) Project. 
#                The insightful knowledge, experience, and abilities I will learn 
#                while working at UCSF’s world-class facility will better prepare 
#                me for my future as a physician and researcher.
 
 
#                In my spare time, I enjoy swimming, hiking, reading, and Pilates.
