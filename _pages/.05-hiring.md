We seek a highly motivated and collaborative postdoctoral scholar to join an 
interdisciplinary research program on experiences of dementia and on the 
development of new treatments
and technologies for neurologic disorders. This work will be directed by 
[Winston Chiong, MD PhD]({{ '/team/index.html#Winston-Chiong' | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }})

The postdoctoral fellow will conduct 
qualitative research (including field observation, interviews, and focus groups) 
with people who have dementia, neurotechnology users, caregivers, and people

This work will be embedded in a broad research program on ethical issues in 
neuroscience, in the 
[UCSF Bioethics](https://bioethics.ucsf.edu){:target="_blank"} program (also
